# Mastermind
Old school Mastermind game played via the terminal

# Features
 - Two difficulties
 - Single and multiplayer 
 - Concidered adding a score counter but figured it wouldn't be difficult to keep track of this themselves and is therefor of no serieus importance

# known bugs
 - Non so far

# I learned that...?
 - linters have its uses, but get in the way when creating apps as well
 - Array.new(5, 'X') makes 5 reference objects (which are ultra cool, but got me to scratch my head a little at first)
 
 
# In hindsight...
 - I could have created a seperat class and instance object to keep track of the roles of each player and switching after each game so that it wouldn't look so messy and confusing
 - The same could be said for storing the secret code, creating a seperate instance object forgoes the use of a class variable
 - I should have asked for help and mentoring, though I am very happy with the final product
 - Creating Player objects and passing those to Game instance object would have made it more straight forward to work with.
